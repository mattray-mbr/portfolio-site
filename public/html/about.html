            <h4 class="headline">Development Emphasis</h4>
            <p class="about-description">Right now my development primarily revolves around JavaScript build systems and frameworks. Almost all of the projects that I have worked on leverage all or parts of the MEAN stack. I also recently have been learning Meteor.js and think it is super awesome. I plan on working with Meteor more in the next few months. For more info about my dev skills check out my github or linkedin profile.</p>

            <p class="about-description">When I'm not coding away in front of a computer screen, I like to get outside and enjoy the awesome Colorado weather. I really enjoy rock climbing and have been doing it since I was a kid. I find that it provides a nice balance for staying active and being outside. It also is a good exercise in problem solving and thinking outside the box.</p>

            <h4 class="headline">Future Goals</h4>
            <p class="about-description">Right now I just want to grow my development skills and get as much exposure as I can to working on different projects. I want to keep my opportunities open and not be forced into one aspect of development too much. This helps with my goal of being a well rounded developer.</p>
