            <p class="description"><span class="update">(currently re-structuring the app with Meteor, check back later for the updated version) </span>Art Spark is a personal project that I made during my time at RefactorU. It is a prototype for a social sharing web app. I am still working on it, so it is not fully functional yet. The overall goal of the site is not to be a popular social app with a steady user base, but to be more of testing ground for me to try out and learn new aspects of web development in a practical environment.</p>

            <a href="http://raycegravity.us" target="_blank"><img class="img-responsive showcase-img" src="../images/RayceMultiple.png" alt=""></a>
            <p class="description">Rayce Gravity is a small startup bussiness that converts downhill mountain bikes into ski-bikes to be rideable all year long. I was contracted to build a basic website for them. It is an easy to follow, one page application that details their companies goals and what they offer currently.</p>

            <p class="description">This is another project that I worked on during RefactorU. It is a one page application that simulates playing the popular casino game of craps. All the dynamic features of the application are done using angular.</p>

            <p class="description">I was recently added to the Appventure team as a developer working on the prototype of their website. Appventure is a brand new startup that connects guides and adventure travelers together. Being that this is a project currently in development, there are many bugs on the site that still need to be worked out, as well as features still to add.</p>
