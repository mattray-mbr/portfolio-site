            <p class="description">Art Spark is a personal project that I made during my time at RefactorU. It is a prototype for a social sharing web app. I am still working on it, so it is not fully functional yet. The overall goal of the site is not to be a popular social app with a steady user base, but to be more of testing ground for me to try out and learn new aspects of web development in a practical environment.</p>

            <p class="description">Rayce Gravity is a small startup bussiness that converts downhill mountain bikes into ski-bikes to be rideable all year long. I was contracted to build a basic website for them. It is an easy to follow, one page application that details their companies goals and what they offer currently.</p>

            <p class="description">This is another project that I worked on during RefactorU. It is a one page application that simulates playing the popular casino game of craps. All the dynamic features of the application are done using angular.</p>
