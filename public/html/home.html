        <p class="overview">Hello from Boulder, Colorado. My name is Matt Ray and I am a junior level web developer. I recently finished with a coding bootcamp called RefactorU. I use this website to Post some of my personal projects as well as general information about myself.</p>

            <p class="description">I was recently added to the AppVenture team as a developer working on the prototype of their website. Appventure is a brand new startup that connects guides and adventure travelers together. We are currently adding more features and doing bug fixes, getting ready for a first concept showcase. Because this is a side project for most of us on the team, we only have time to work on it occasionally.</p>

            <!-- <p class="description">Art Spark is a personal project that I made during my time at RefactorU. It is a prototype for a social sharing web app. I am still working on it, so it is not fully functional yet. The overall goal of the site is not to be a popular social app with a steady user base, but to be more of testing ground for me to try out and learn new aspects of web development in a practical environment.</p> -->
