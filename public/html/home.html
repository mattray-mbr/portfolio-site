            <p class="description">Art Spark is a personal project that I made during my time at RefactorU. It is a prototype for a social sharing web app. I am still working on it, so it is not fully functional yet. The overall goal of the site is not to be a popular social app with a steady user base, but to be more of testing ground for me to try out and learn new aspects of web development in a practical environment.</p>
